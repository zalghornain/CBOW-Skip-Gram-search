    abstract = { Query expansion terms are often used to enhance original query formulations in document retrieval. Such terms are usually selected from the entire documents or from windows or passages surrounding query term occurrences. Arguably, the semantic relatedness between terms weakens with the increase in the distance separating them. In this paper we report a study that was conducted to systematically evaluate different distance functions for selecting query expansion terms. We propose a distance factor that can be effectively combined with the statistical term association measure of mutual information for selecting query expansion terms. Evaluation of the TREC collection shows that distance-weighted mutual information is more effective than mutual information alone in selecting terms for query expansion. }

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is an area that gains wide interest from research because of its importance and advantages in various fields. Different approaches and techniques are used to classify the sentiment of texts. Word embedding is one of the effective methods that represent aspects of word meaning and help to improve sentiment classification accuracy. Word2vec is well-known and widely used in learning word embedding that includes two models: Skip-Gram (SG) model and Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW). Some of the studies use one of these models and other studies use both of them. In this survey, we highlight the latest studies on using the Word2vec model for sentiment analysis and its role in improving sentiment classification accuracy.},
